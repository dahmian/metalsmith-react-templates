title: "Article 1: Static Page Generation with Isomorphic React"
---
<p>This is a demo of Isomorphic React using the static site generator <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>.</p>
<p>When you first enter the site, you were served a full HTML page, but subsequent page loads will only load JSON. Unlike an Isomorphic app, all the HTML and JSON are generated in advance. This radically reduces server load.</p>
<p>Below are a few links to test out the JSON loading code.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="article2.html">Article 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="article23.html">Broken Article Link</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The input box lets you test data retention. If you enter in text and click on a valid article link, your input text should be retained.</p>
